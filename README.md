Russian sentiment analysis evaluation SentiRuEval-2016 devoted to reputation monitoring of banks and telecom companies in Twitter. We describe the task, data, the procedure of data preparation, and participantsâ€™ results. At the previous evaluation SentiRuEval-2015, it was noticed that the presented machine-learning approaches significantly depended on the training collection, which was not enough for qualitative classification of the test collection because of data sparsity and time gap. The current results of the participants at SentiRuEval-2016 showed that they have made successful steps to overcome the above-mentioned problems by combining machine-learning approaches and additional manual and automatically generated lexical resources.
